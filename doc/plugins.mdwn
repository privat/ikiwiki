Most of ikiwiki's [[features]] are implemented as plugins. Many of these 
plugins are included with ikiwiki.

[[!pagestats pages="plugins/type/* and !plugins/type/slow" among="plugins/*"]]

There's documentation if you want to [[write]] your own plugins, or you can
[[install]] plugins [[contributed|contrib]] by others.

To enable a plugin, use the `--plugin` switch described in
[[usage]], or the equivalent `add_plugins` line in ikiwiki.setup.
Enable the [[goodstuff]] plugin to get a nice selection of plugins that
will fit most uses of ikiwiki.
