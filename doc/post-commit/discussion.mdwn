Hi Joey and many thanks for your work on ikiwiki, as usual you give us a very good soft...

I want to be able to edit my website from a navigator (with the CGI) and
from my favorite editor on my laptop. I have managed to use the subversion wrapper
so I have write a post-commit hook with : 

    cd /~/wikisrc/ 
    svn up
    /usr/bin/ikiwiki --setup ../ikiwiki.setup

at the end.

This configuration works for me, the svn wrapper doesn't seems to
do the svn up stuff so I wonder if I've missed something...

Regards.

Hello, I've setup ikiwiki with subversion. I can edit pages from web browser using CGI and, when I go to recentchanges, it shows that modification with "web" word. But, if I modify any .mdwn file, it gets updated in website but it doesn't show in recentchanges entry with "svn" word. If I run "svn ci -m changes", it shows in recentchanges correctly.

So, I think I miss something, because I don't think I must run "svn add" or "svn commit" anytime I modify or create a wiki file.

Thanks

I'm working on an [[rcs]] plugin for CVS, adapted from `svn.pm`, in order to integrate ikiwiki at sites where that's all they've got. What's working so far: web commit (post-commit hook and all), diff, add (under certain conditions), and remove. What's not working: with rcs_add(), iff any of the new page's parent dirs aren't already under CVS control and the post-commit hook is enabled, the browser and ikiwiki stall for several seconds trying to add it, then time out. (If I kill ikiwiki when this is happening, it cvs adds the topmost parent that needed adding; if I wait for timeout, it doesn't. I think.) If I disable the post-commit hook and do the same kind of thing, the page is created and saved.

In case you're lucky enough not to know, cvs adds on directories are weird -- they operate immediately against the repository, unlike file adds:

    $ cvs add randomdir
    Directory /Users/schmonz/Documents/cvswiki/repository/ikiwiki/randomdir added to the repository

I was able to work out that when I'm seeing this page save misbehavior, my plugin is somewhere inside `system("cvs", "-Q", "add", "$file")`, which was never returning. If I changed it to anything other than cvs it iterated correctly over all the parent dirs which needed to be added to CVS, in the proper order. (cvs add isn't recursive, sadly.)

Can you offer an educated guess what's going wrong here? --[[Schmonz]]
