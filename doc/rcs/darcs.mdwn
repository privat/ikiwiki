[Darcs](http://darcs.new) is a distributed revison control
system. Ikiwiki supports storing a wiki in a
Darcs repository.

An Ikiwiki wrapper is run by the `posthook` to update a wiki whenever commits
or remote pushes come in. When running as a [[cgi]] with Darcs, ikiwiki
automatically commits edited pages, and uses the Darcs history to generate the
[[RecentChanges]] page.

Example for a `_darcs/prefs/defaults` file in `$SRCDIR`:

	apply posthook /path/to/repository/_darcs/ikiwiki-wrapper
	apply run-posthook
