When I started ikiwiki in 2006, there were no other existing systems that
filled quite the niche of generating a static html wiki out of markdown
files stored in a [[VCS|rcs]]. My 
[first blog about ikiwiki](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/seeking_wiki/)
looked at some projects that were semi-close, and found them wanting.

My hope was that besides being useful to all its [[users|ikiwikiusers]],
ikiwiki would help spread its underlying concepts. Let a thousand flowers
bloom! These are some that have sprung up since. --[[Joey]]

* [Gitit](http://gitit.johnmacfarlane.net/) is a wiki backed by a git (or
  darcs) filestore. No static rendering here; pages are generated on the fly.
  It's written in Haskell and uses the amazing PanDoc to generate html
  from markdown or many other formats.

* [Markdoc](http://blog.zacharyvoase.com/post/246800035) statically builds
  a wiki from markdown source (which can be in a VCS, if you check it in).
  It includes a built-in webserver to ease serving the generated static
  html.
