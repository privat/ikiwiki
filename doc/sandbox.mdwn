While working on [[http://eoffice.im.fju.edu.tw/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=27199|[97] Phpbb 與 Dokuwiki 之間的往來]] (External Link to //http://eoffice.im.fju.edu.tw/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=27199// not working?), surf Internet for Wikis supporting //Creole V1.0//, found this site.

<<<<<<< HEAD:doc/sandbox.mdwn
* I thought that creole markup is used by ikiwiki...
* Thought about using //SVN/CVS// server, however with different idea
* Kinda curious why **Tcl** does not show her face in this Wiki arena

* It looks like that I was wrong, from Wikipedia Creole page it mention that ikiwiki is also adopting Creole markup.

This SandBox is also a [[blog]]!

[[!inline pages="sandbox/* and !*/Discussion" rootpage="sandbox" show="4" archive="yes"]]

This gives an example of inline code: `tar | netcat` is a nice way to transfer bulk files over the net

But, of course, rsync is better.
