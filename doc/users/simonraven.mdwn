## personal/site info

New ikiwiki site at my web site, blog, kisikew.org home site, for indigenews, and our indigenous-centric wiki (mostly East Coast/Woodlands area). Mediawiki stuff was imported successfully (as noted on this web site).

## ikiwiki branch at github

Maintain my own branch, partly to learn about VCS, git, ikiwiki, Debian packaging, and Perl. I don't recommend anyone pull from it, as I use third-party plugins included on this site that people may not want in a default installation of ikiwiki. This is why I don't push to Joey's -- so it's nothing personal, I just don't want to mess things up for other people, from my mistakes and stumbles.
