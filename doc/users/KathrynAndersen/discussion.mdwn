Had a look at your site. Sprawling, individualistic, using ikiwiki in lots of
ways. Makes me happy. :) I see that I have let a lot of contrib plugins
pile up. I will try to get to these. I'm particularly interested in
your use of yaml+fields. Encourage you to go ahead with any others you
have not submitted here, like pmap. (Unless it makes more sense to submit
that as a patch to the existing map plugin.) --[[Joey]] 

> Thanks.  I would have put more up, but I didn't want to until they were properly documented, and other things have taken a higher priority.

>>> Unfortunately, HTML::LinkList isn't an optional feature for pmap; that's what it uses to create the HTML for the map. --[[KathrynAndersen]]

> The "includepage" plugin I'm not sure whether it is worth releasing or not; it's basically a cut-down version of "inline", because the inline plugin is so complicated and has so many options, I felt more at ease to have something simpler.
