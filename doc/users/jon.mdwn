[[!meta title="Jon Dowland"]]
I'm looking at ikiwiki both for my personal site but also as a
team-documentation management system for a small-sized group of UNIX
sysadmins.

* my edits should appear either as 'Jon' (if I've used
  [[tips/untrusted_git_push]]) or 'jmtd.net' (or once upon a time
  'alcopop.org/me/openid/' or 'jondowland').
* My [homepage](http://jmtd.net/) is powered by ikiwiki

I gave a talk at the [UK UNIX User's Group](http://www.ukuug.org/) annual
[Linux conference](http://www.ukuug.org/events/linux2008/) about organising
system administrator documentation. Roughly a third of this talk was
discussing IkiWiki in some technical detail and suggesting it as a good piece
of software for this task.

I am also working on some ikiwiki hacks:

* an alternative approach to [[plugins/comments]] (see
  [[todo/more flexible inline postform]] for one piece of the puzzle;
  <http://dev.jmtd.net/comments/> for some investigation into making the post
  form more integrated); possibly also [[todo/pagespec to disable ikiwiki directives]]
* a system for [[forum/managing_todo_lists]] (see also
  [[todo/interactive todo lists]] and <http://dev.jmtd.net/outliner/> for the
  current WIP).

I am currently mostly interested in ikiwiki usability issues:

 * [[bugs/the login page is unclear when multiple methods exist]]
 * [[bugs/backlinks onhover thing can go weird]]
 * [[todo/CSS classes for links]]
