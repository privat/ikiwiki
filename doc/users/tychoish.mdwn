I'm Sam Kleinman ([tychoish](http://www.tychoish.com/)), and I use ikiwiki. 

I used to use ikiwiki a bunch, in a purely local setup, for various projects and personal note taking of various kinds. I've since switched to using [orgmode](http://www.orgmode.org) and a number of just regular old git repositories with some textfiles in them, which seems to work just as well for my particular use case. 

Currently, I'm using ikiwiki on the [cyborg institute wiki](http://www.cyborginstitute.com/wiki/) and I'm working on helping someone develop a collaborative fiction project at the [critical futures wiki](http://www.criticalfutures.com/wiki/)... and I'm thinking about other projects, but nothing that exists enough to mention here. 

I hang out in #ikiwiki on oftc, and I'm working on getting some of my templates in order to share with you all. Soon. For sure. 

Cheers,
tychoish
