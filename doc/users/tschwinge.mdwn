I have converted the [GNU Hurd](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/)'s previous
web pages and previous wiki pages to a *[[ikiwiki]]* system; and all that while
preserving the previous content's history, which was stored in a CVS repository
for the HTML web pages and a TWiki RCS repository for the wiki; see
<http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/colophon.html>.
