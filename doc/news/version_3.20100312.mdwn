   * Fix utf8 issues in calls to md5\_hex.
   * moderatedcomments: Added moderate\_pagespec that can be used
     to control which users or comment locations are moderated.
     This can be used, just for example, to moderate "user(http://myopenid.com/*)"
     if you're getting a lot of spammers from one particular openid
     provider (who should perhaps answer your emails about them),
     while not moderating other users.
   * moderatedcomments: The moderate\_users setting is deprecated. Instead,
     set moderate\_pagespec to "!admin()" or "user(*)".
   * Fix missing span on recentchanges page template.
   * search: Avoid '$' in the wikiname appearing unescaped on omega's
     query template, where it might crash omega.
   * htmlscrubber: Security fix: In data:image/* uris, only allow a few
     whitelisted image types. No svg."""]]
