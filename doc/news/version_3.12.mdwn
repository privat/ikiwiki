You may want to run `ikiwiki-transition deduplinks /path/to/srcdir`
after upgrading to this version of ikiwiki. This command will
optimise your wiki's saved state, removing duplicate information
that can slow ikiwiki down.

ikiwiki 3.12 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
  * Re-enable python-support and add python:Depends to control file.
  * ikiwiki-makerepo: Avoid using abs_path, as it apparently
    fails on nonexistant directories with some broken perl
    versions.
  * inline: Minor optimisation.
  * add_link: New function, which plugins should use rather than
    modifying %links directly, to avoid it accumulating duplicates.
  * ikiwiki-transition: Add a deduplinks action, that can be used
    to remove duplicate links and optimise a wiki w/o rebuilding it.
  * external: Fix pagespec_match and pagespec_match_list.
    Closes: #527281
