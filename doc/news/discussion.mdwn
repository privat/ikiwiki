## 3.20091017 news item removed?
Hi! Why have you [removed](http://git.ikiwiki.info/?p=ikiwiki;a=blobdiff;f=doc/news/version_3.20091017.mdwn;h=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;hp=aba830a82f881bd97d11fe644eb2c78b99c2258d;hb=9fdd9af2db2bd21e543fa0f5f4bfa85b56b8dd5c;hpb=b74dceb884a60f6f7be395378a009ee414726d0b) the item for 
3.20091017? Perhaps, it's an error, isn't it? The corresponding code AFAIU is still there. --Ivan Z.

> I always remove old news items when making a new release. The info is still there in the changelog if needed. --[[Joey]]

## Ikiwiki 2.14

Hi Joey! Where can I find the source package for ikiwiki 2.14? I rather prefer
`wget` than `git` to download it :) I've just checked
[Debian page of ikiwiki source package](http://packages.debian.org/unstable/source/ikiwiki)
and it seems that it still contains older version 2.13. I didn't found
the latest version at <http://incoming.debian.org/> too. --[[Paweł|ptecza]]

> 2.14 is at the url you cited now. --[[Joey]]

>> Thanks! I can confirm it :) I'm curious what a reason of "delay" is?
>> The sources were accepted in unstable 2 days ago... Please forgive me
>> if it's a stupid question, but I don't know how exactly it works in
>> Debian project. --[[Paweł|ptecza]]

>>> After I upload, ikiwiki is not pushed out to the mirrors until the
>>> twice-daily mirror sync. After that, packages.debian.org has to run its
>>> update. I'm not sure what the timing of that is, it seems to be
>>> somewhat slower than the mirror sync, and also more subject to breaking
>>> from time to time. --[[Joey]]

>>>> Thank you for the explanation! :) --[[Paweł|ptecza]]
