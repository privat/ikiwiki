## Ikiwiki 2.14

Hi Joey! Where can I find the source package for ikiwiki 2.14? I rather prefer
`wget` than `git` to download it :) I've just checked
[Debian page of ikiwiki source package](http://packages.debian.org/unstable/source/ikiwiki)
and it seems that it still contains older version 2.13. I didn't found
the latest version at <http://incoming.debian.org/> too. --[[Paweł|ptecza]]

> 2.14 is at the url you cited now. --[[Joey]]

>> Thanks! I can confirm it :) I'm curious what a reason of "delay" is?
>> The sources were accepted in unstable 2 days ago... Please forgive me
>> if it's a stupid question, but I don't know how exactly it works in
>> Debian project. --[[Paweł|ptecza]]

>>> After I upload, ikiwiki is not pushed out to the mirrors until the
>>> twice-daily mirror sync. After that, packages.debian.org has to run its
>>> update. I'm not sure what the timing of that is, it seems to be
>>> somewhat slower than the mirror sync, and also more subject to breaking
>>> from time to time. --[[Joey]]

>>>> Thank you for the explanation! :) --[[Paweł|ptecza]]
