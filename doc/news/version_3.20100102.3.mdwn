ikiwiki 3.20100102.3 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   Happy palindrome day!

   * pagestats: Add show parameter. Closes: #[562129](http://bugs.debian.org/562129) (David Paleino)
   * toc: Add startlevel parameter. (kerravonsen)
   * Remove example ikiwiki setup file from the Debian package. This
     re-enables linking to /usr/share/ikiwiki/examples which has the
     example sites also used by auto-blog.setup. The example setup file
     can be generated at any time using ikiwiki --dumpsetup so I do
     not see a reason to ship it. Closes: #[562183](http://bugs.debian.org/562183)
   * Use env hack in python scripts.
   * comments: Add a checksum to the name of comment pages, to
     avoid merge conflicts when comments are posted to two branches of a
     site.
   * linkmap: Add option to omit disconnected pages from the map.
   * inline: Fix bug that limited displayed pages when feedshow was
     specified w/o show.
   * Fix several places that did not properly handle capitalization of
     the discussionpage setting. Specifically, fixes discussion actions
     on discussion pages, and unbreaks the opendiscussion plugin."""]]
