News for ikiwiki 3.13:

   The `ikiwiki-transition deduplinks` command introduced in the
   last release was buggy. If you followed the NEWS file instructions
   and ran it, you should run `ikiwiki -setup` to rebuild your wiki
   to fix the problem.

ikiwiki 3.13 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * ikiwiki-transition: If passed a nonexistant srcdir, or one not
     containing .ikiwiki, abort with an error rather than creating it.
   * Allow underlaydir to be overridden without messing up inclusion
     of other underlays via add\_underlay.
   * More friendly display of markdown, textile in edit form selector
     (jmtd)
   * Allow curly braces to be used in pagespecs, and avoid a whole class
     of potential security problems, by avoiding performing any string
     interpolation on user-supplied data when translating pagespecs.
   * ikiwiki-transition: Allow setup files to be passed to all subcommands
     that need a srcdir.
   * ikiwiki-transition: deduplinks was broken and threw away all
     metadata stored by plugins in the index. Fix this bug.
   * listdirectives: Avoid listing \_comment directives and generally
     assume any directive starting with \_ is likewise internal."""]]
