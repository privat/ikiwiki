ikiwiki 3.14 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * highlight: New plugin supporting syntax highlighting of pretty much
     anything.
   * debian/control: Add suggests for libhighlight-perl, although
     that package is not yet created by Debian's highlight source package.
     (See #529869)
   * format: Provide a htmlizefallback hook that other plugins
     can use to handle formats that are not suitable for general-purpose
     htmlize hooks. Used by highlight.
   * Fix test suite to not rely on an installed copy of ikiwiki after
     underlaydir change. Closes: #[530502](http://bugs.debian.org/530502)
   * Danish translation update. Closes: #[530877](http://bugs.debian.org/530877)"""]]
