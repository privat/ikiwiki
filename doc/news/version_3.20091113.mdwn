ikiwiki 3.20091113 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * underlay: Fix example values put in setup file to be array
     references.
   * underlay: Avoid crashing if lists of underlays (or template
     directories) are not configured.
   * Moved the postscan hook to run on the raw html of a page, before
     the template is filled out. This improves the search plugin's indexing,
     since it will not include navigational elements from the page template
     or sidebar.
   * localstyle: New plugin, allows overrding the toplevel local.css
     with one that is closer to a page.
   * httpauth: Add cgiauthurl setting that can be used to do http basic auth
     only when ikiwiki needs authentication, rather than for any access to
     the cgi/wiki.
   * inline: Do not generate feeds for nested inlines.
   * inline: Allow direct inclusion of non-page files in raw mode.
   * inline: Fix display of all pages when archive=yes or show=0 are used."""]]
