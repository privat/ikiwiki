ikiwiki 3.20091031 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * po: Fix breakage caused by changes to render code.
   * mdwn: Avoid trying to use multimarkdown if it is not installed.
   * moderatedcomments: New plugin to allow comment moderation w/o relying
     on blogspam.net.
   * When redirecting to a page, ie, after editing, ensure that the
     url is uri-encoded. Most browsers other than MSIE don't care, but it's
     the right thing to do.
   * Add a spec file to allow building rpm from the source package.
   * google: Pass the whole wiki url to google, not just the domain,
     so that search works correctly for wikis that are located in
     subdirectories of domains."""]]
