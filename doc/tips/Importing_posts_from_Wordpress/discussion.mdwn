When I attempt to use this script, I get the following error:
warning: Not updating refs/heads/master (new tip 26b1787fca04f2f9772b6854843fe99fe06e6088 does not contain fc0ad65d14d88fd27a6cee74c7cef3176f6900ec).  I have git 1.5.6.5, any ideas?

Thanks!!

### KeyError: 146

I also get this error, here's the output (it seems to stem from an error in the python script):

<pre>

etc.


> Well, if this really is a script error, it's not really the script, but the wordpress XML dump, referring to a

>> This is only part of the problem... I'm not exactly sure what's going on, and it's get late/early for me....

>>> I used --force for fast-import, but then everything seems deleted, so you end up doing a reset, checkout, add, *then* commit.
>>> Seems really odd. I edited the script however, maybe this is why... this is my changes:

    -print "data %d" % len(data)
    +print "data %d merge refs/heads/%s" % (len(data), branch)

>>> That control character is a ^q^0 in emacs, see git fast-import --help for more info.
>>> I'll be trying an import *without* that change, to see what happens.

>>>> I still have to do the above to preserve the changes done by this script... (removed previous note).
