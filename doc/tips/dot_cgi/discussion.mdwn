## warning: lighttpd only or both?

Is your warning at the bottom (you don't know how secure it is) only about
lighttpd or it's about apache2 configuration as well?

I'm asking this because right now I want to setup an httpd solely for the
public use of ikiwiki on a general purpose computer (there are other things
there), and so I need to choose the more secure solution. --Ivan Z.
