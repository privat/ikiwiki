I managed to install ikiwiki on eggplant farms, with most basic features except markdown.

I think ikiwiki is more suitable for VPS/dedicated server. Shared hosting doesn't fit.

I just (2009/04/27) installed ikiwiki on DreamHost and the CPAN instructions here are unnecessarily complicated. I used "cpan" instead of "perl -MCPAN -e shell" and had no trouble with  that portion of the install. --[[schmonz]]
