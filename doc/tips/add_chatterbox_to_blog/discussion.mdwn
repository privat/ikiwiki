The example you gave looks a bit odd.

This is what I did from your example (still trying to learn the more complex things ;).

<pre>
\[[!template id=note text="""
\[[!aggregate expirecount=5 name=kijkaqawej url=http://identi.ca/kjikaqawej
feedurl=http://identi.ca/api/statuses/user_timeline/kjikaqawej.atom]]
\[[!inline pages="internal(kijkaqawej/*)" template=microblog show=5 feeds=no]] """]]
</pre>

mine, live, here: <http://simonraven.kisikew.org/blog/meta/microblog-feed/>

I expected something like: sidebar, with a number, and displaying them in the sidebar, but they don't display (similar to what you have on your blog).

On the [[/ikwiki/pagespec]] page, it says "internal" pages aren't "first-class" wiki pages, so it's best not to directly display them, so how do you manage to display them? I'd like to display their name, and what they link to in the sidebar, or otherwise in the main body.
