[[!template id=plugin name=getsource author="[[Will_Uther|Will]]"]]

This plugin adds a "Source" link to the top of each page that uses
the CGI to display the page's source.

Configuration for this plugin in the setup file:

* `getsource_mimetype => "text/plain; charset=utf-8"`

  Sets the MIME type used when page source is requested. The default is
  usually appropriate, but you could set this to `application/octet-stream`
  to encourage browsers to download the source to a file rather than showing
  it in the browser.
