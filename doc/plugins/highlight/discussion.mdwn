It would be nice to be able to set a few options for the highlighter object. In particular, today I noticed my tabs were not being expanded correctly, which could 
be fixed the command line with --replace-tabs but programmatically needs a call to setPreformatting.  I could probably play with this, but what is your preferred way to support 
options? something like 'highlight_options=>{replace_tabs=>8,line_numbers=>0}' ?  Of course, if you want to implement it I won't complain :-). [[DavidBremner]]
