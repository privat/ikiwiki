> Warning: Any change to the sidebar will cause a rebuild of the whole wiki, since every page includes a copy that has to be updated. This can especially be a problem if the sidebar includes inline or map directives, since any changes to pages inlined or mapped onto the sidebar will change the sidebar and cause a full wiki rebuild.

I tried exactly that, namely having an inline in my sidebar to include an rss feed from some other side. I think the complete wiki rebuild should be doable every few days when a new article appears in that feed. But contrary to that warning there is no complete wiki rebuild, only the sidebar page is rebuilt by the "ikiwiki --aggregate" from cron. Is that a bug or a feature?
