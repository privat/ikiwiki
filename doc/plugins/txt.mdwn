[[!tag type/format]]

This plugin makes ikiwiki treat files with names ending in ".txt"
as wiki pages.

Unlike other [[type/format]] plugins, no formatting of markup in 
txt files is done; the file contents is displayed to the user as-is,
with html markup characters such as ">" escaped.

The only exceptions are that [[WikiLinks|ikiwiki/WikiLink]] and
[[directives|ikiwiki/directive]] are still expanded by
ikiwiki, and that, if the [[!cpan URI::Find]] perl module is installed, URLs
in the txt file are converted to hyperlinks.

----

As a special case, a file `robots.txt` will be copied intact into the
`destdir`, as well as creating a wiki page named "robots".
