This plugin lets you use the IkiWiki CGI script as an Apache 404 handler,
to give the behaviour of various other wiki engines where visiting a
nonexistent page provides you with a link to create it.

To achieve this, put something like this in the wiki's Apache configuration
file:

    ErrorDocument 404 /ikiwiki.cgi

(The path here needs to be whatever the path is to the ikiwiki.cgi from
the root of your web server.)

Or put something like this in the wiki's Lighttpd (>=1.4.17) configuration file:

    server.error-handler-404 = "/ikiwiki.cgi"
