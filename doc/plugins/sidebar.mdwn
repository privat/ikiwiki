[[!template id=plugin name=sidebar author="Tuomo Valkonen"]]
[[!tag type/chrome]]

If this plugin is enabled, then a sidebar is added to pages in the wiki.
The content of the sidebar is simply the content of a page named
"sidebar" (ie, create a "sidebar.mdwn").

Typically this will be a page in the root of the wiki, but it can also be a
[[ikiwiki/SubPage]]. In fact, this page,
[[plugins/sidebar|plugins/sidebar]], will be treated as a sidebar for the
[[plugins]] page, and of all of its SubPages, if the plugin is enabled.

Note that to disable a sidebar for a [[ikiwiki/SubPage]] of a page that has
a sidebar, you can create a sidebar page that is completely empty. This
will turn off the sidebar altogether.

Warning: Any change to the sidebar will cause a rebuild of the whole wiki,
since every page includes a copy that has to be updated. This can
especially be a problem if the sidebar includes an [[ikiwiki/directive/inline]]
directive, since any changes to pages inlined into the sidebar
will change the sidebar and cause a full wiki rebuild.

Instead, if you include a [[ikiwiki/directive/map]] directive on the sidebar,
and it does not use the `show` parameter, only adding or removing pages
included in the map will cause a full rebuild. Modifying pages will not.
