This plugin allows adding a sidebar to pages in the wiki.

By default, and unless the `global_sidebars` setting is turned off,
a sidebar is added to all pages in the wiki. The content of the sidebar
is simply the content of a page named "sidebar" (ie, create a "sidebar.mdwn").

Typically this will be a page in the root of the wiki, but it can also be a
[[ikiwiki/SubPage]]. In fact, this page,
[[plugins/sidebar|plugins/sidebar]], will be treated as a sidebar for the
[[plugins]] page, and of all of its SubPages, if the plugin is enabled.

There is also a [[ikiwiki/directive/sidebar]] directive that can be used
to provide a custom sidebar content for a page.

----

Warning: Any change to the sidebar page will cause a rebuild of the whole
wiki, since every page includes a copy that has to be updated. This can
especially be a problem if the sidebar includes an
[[ikiwiki/directive/inline]] directive, since any changes to pages inlined
into the sidebar will change the sidebar and cause a full wiki rebuild.

Instead, if you include a [[ikiwiki/directive/map]] directive on the sidebar,
and it does not use the `show` parameter, only adding or removing pages
included in the map will cause a full rebuild. Modifying pages will not.
