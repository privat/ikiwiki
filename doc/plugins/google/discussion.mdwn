This plugin uses the googleform.tmpl
which produces valid HTML but invalid XHTML.
This is not very good since the default ikiwiki
templates produce XHTML instead of HTML.

It works to pass the whole wiki baseurl to Google, not just the
domain, and appears to be legal. I've got a wiki that'd benefit
(it's a few directories down from the root). Can the plugin be
tweaked to do this? --[[schmonz]]

Is it still true now? (Or this statement is out of date?)  --[weakish]
