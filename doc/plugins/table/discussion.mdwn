Well, that's an one workaround for (some versions of) markdown's
lack of tables..

Interesting that you chose to use CSV format. Seems there are advantages
(standardisation) and disadvantages (limited to simple tables).

# Patch for new header options

I have written a small patch for this plugin to enable the first column as a header instead of just the first row or no header.

In my version, there is three options for the header field :

+ **no**: no header;
+ **col**: the first column as header;
+ **row**: the first row as header (for compatibility reason, **yes** is an alternate value for this option). 

Here is the links to the patch and to a patched version of the plugin :

+ [table.pm.patch](http://alexandre.dupas.free.fr/code/ikiwiki/table.pm.patch)
+ [table.pm](http://alexandre.dupas.free.fr/code/ikiwiki/table.pm)

I hope this might be intresting for some ikiwiki user's.

# Horizontal cell alignment

Do you know any easy method of horizontal cell alignment? I know I can set `class`
attribute for the table, but how to set different `class` for different cells?

[DokuWiki](http://www.dokuwiki.org/) has a nice horizontal alignment solution.
Suppose that we have `|foo|` cell. If I want to align the cell to left,
then I should type `|foo |`. If I want to do right alignment, then I type `| foo|`.
For centering cell content I need to type `| foo |`. Please note that I used
only one space for all examples, but in DokuWiki I can use many spaces.

Do you like it? Can you implement the same in Ikiwiki? :) --[[Paweł|ptecza]]

If you see `[[!table\ Error: ]]` you probably need to `sudo apt-get install libtext-csv-perl`.
