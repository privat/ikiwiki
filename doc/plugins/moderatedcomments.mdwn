[[!tag type/auth]]

This plugin causes [[comments]] to be held for manual moderation.
Admins can access the comment moderation queue via their preferences page.

By default, all comments made by anyone who is not an admin will be held
for moderation. The `moderate_users` setting can be set to false to avoid
moderating comments of logged-in users, while still moderating anonymous
comments.
