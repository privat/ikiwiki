By default, anonymous users cannot edit the wiki. This plugin allows
anonymous web users, who have not signed in, to edit any page in the wiki
by default.

The plugin also has a configuration setting, `anonok_pagespec`. This
[[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] can be used to allow anonymous editing of matching pages.

If you're using the [[comments]] plugin, you can allow anonymous comments
to be posted by setting:

	anonok_pagespec => "postcomment(*)"
