This plugin provides a [[ikiwiki/directive/haiku]] [[ikiwiki/directive]].
The directive allows inserting a randomly generated haiku into a wiki page.

As a special bonus, enabling this plugin makes any error messages ikiwiki
should display be written in haiku.

You need to have the [[!cpan Coy]] module installed for this plugin to do
anything interesting. That does all the heavy lifting.
