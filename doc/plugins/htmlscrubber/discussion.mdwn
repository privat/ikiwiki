**Ok, I have yet to post a big dummy wiki-noobie question around here, so here goes:**

Yes, I want to play around with *gulp* Google Ads on an ikiwiki blog, namely, in the *sidebar*. 

No, I do not want to turn htmlscrubber off, but apart from that I have not been able to allow &lt;script&gt; elements as required by Google.

Thoughts?

***Fixed!***

Did some more reading, did some searching on the wiki, and found, under *embed*, these

    htmlscrubber_skip => '!*/Discussion',
    locked_pages => '!*/Discussion',

Thanks!
