## Conditional broken?

Using \[\[!if test="tagged(plugin)" then="= Tagged as plugin =" else="*No plugins found*"]] on this wiki *should* present the 'Tagged as plugin' heading, instead it emits 'no plugins found'. Is the conditional plugin currently broken for tags or am I misusing it? Thanks.

Would there be a way for this plugin to emit fewer blank lines (i.e. *none at all*)?

For example, having a look at [this page](http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/Hurd/)'s sidebar.
This [sidebar](http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/sidebar/)
([source code](http://www.bddebian.com/gitweb/?p=wiki;a=blob_plain;f=sidebar.mdwn))
is supposed to have *no* blank lines between...

* **Hurd** and *About*,
* *Todo* and **Mach**,
* **Mach** and **Mig**.

I have a sidebar that contains
<pre>
  #### Archives

  \[[!calendar type="year" months_per_row="6"  pages="blog/* and !*/Discussion"]]
  \[[!calendar type="month" pages="blog/* and !*/Discussion"]]
  &lt;h4&gt;Indices&lt;/h4&gt
  \[[!map pages="archives/* and !*/Discussion"]]
</pre>
I am trying to make it so that the archives and index only show up if the destpage is either blog/* or / -- the top of the wiki. Unfortunately, I don't think I am getting the
conditional right -- I have a "]] left over at the end (looking at the rendered html). Ideally, I would like to be able to do todays calendar on the top level pagel and 
the annual calendar on archives/200[4567].mdwn, and monthly calendars for the proper month on archives/200[4567]/[0..12].mdwn. Do I have to create separate sidebars?
I do not use the usedir directive, so all my annual archive pages live in archives/, and all my monthly archive pages live in, say, archives/2007/ --ManojSrivastava
