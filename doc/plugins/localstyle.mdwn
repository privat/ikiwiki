This plugin allows styling different sections of a wiki using different
versions of the local.css [[CSS]] file. Normally this file is read from the
top level of the wiki, but with this plugin enabled, standard
[[ikiwiki/subpage/LinkingRules]] are used to find the closest local.css
file to each page.

So, for example, to use different styling for page `foo`, as well as all
of its [[SubPages|ikiwiki/subpage]], such as `foo/bar`, create a
`foo/local.css`.
