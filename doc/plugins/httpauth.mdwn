This plugin allows HTTP basic authentication to be used to log into the
wiki. 

## fully authenticated wiki

One way to use the plugin is to configure your web server to require
HTTP basic authentication for any access to the directory containing the
wiki (and `ikiwiki.cgi`). The authenticated user will be automatically
signed into the wiki. This method is suitable only for private wikis.

## separate cgiauthurl

To use httpauth for a wiki where the content is public, and where
the `ikiwiki.cgi` needs to be usable without authentication (for searching
and so on), you can configure a separate url that is used for
authentication, via the `cgiauthurl` option in the setup file. This
url will then be redirected to whenever authentication is needed.

A typical setup is to make an `auth` subdirectory, and symlink `ikiwiki.cgi` 
into it. Then configure the web server to require authentication only for
access to the `auth` subdirectory. Then `cgiauthurl` is pointed at this
symlink.
