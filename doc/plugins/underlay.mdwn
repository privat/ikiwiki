This plugin adds an `add_underlays` option to the setup file. Its value is
a list of underlay directories whose content is added to the wiki.

Multiple underlays are normally set up automatically by other plugins (for
instance, the images used by the [[plugins/smiley]] plugin), but they can
also be used as a way to pull in external files that you don't want in
revision control, like photos or software releases.

Directories in `add_underlays` should usually be absolute. If relative,
they're interpreted as relative to the parent directory of the basewiki
underlay, which is probably not particularly useful in this context.

This plugin also adds an `add_templates` option to the setup file.
Its value is a list of template directories to look for template files in,
if they are not present in the `templatedir`.
