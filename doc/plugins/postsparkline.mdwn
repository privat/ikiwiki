This plugin provides the [[ikiwiki/directive/postsparkline]] [[ikiwiki/directive]].
It uses the [[sparkline]] plugin to create a sparkline of
statistics about a set of pages, such as posts to a blog.

# adding formulae

Additional formulae can be added without modifying this plugin by writing
plugins that register functions in the
`IkiWiki::Plugin::postsparkline::formula` namespace. These functions will
receive on input a reference to a hash of parameters, and a sorted list of
pages, and should return a list of data points for the sparkline plugin.
