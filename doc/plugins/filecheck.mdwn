This plugin enhances the regular [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] syntax with
some additional tests, for things like file size, mime type, and virus
status. These tests are mostly useful for the [[attachment]] plugin, and
are documented [[here|ikiwiki/pagespec/attachment]].

This plugin will use the [[!cpan File::MimeInfo::Magic]] perl module, if
available, for mimetype checking.

The `virusfree` [[PageSpec|ikiwiki/pagespec/attachment]] requires that
ikiwiki be configured with a virus scanner program via the `virus_checker`
option in the setup file. If using `clamav`, with `clamd`, set it to
"clamdscan -". Or to use clamav without the `clamd` daemon, you
could set it to "clamscan -".
