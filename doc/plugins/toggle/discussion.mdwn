## Nested plugins

Is it possible to use another plugin into your toggle plugin? For example,
I want to have toggleable table and try to use [[Victor Moral|users/victormoral]]'s [[table plugin|plugins/table]],
but no success. How can I do it?

## Using toggle directives in a list item##
Take this code snippet.

    * [[!toggle id="test" text="test"]]
      [[!toggleable id="test text="""toggle"""]]

In the HTML-output the `ul` and `div` overlap.

    <div id="content">
    <ul>
    <li><a class="toggle" href="#test.test">test</a>
    <div class="toggleable" id="test.-test"></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>toggle</p>
    
    </div>
    
    </div>

Fixing this manually the Javascript seems not to be working and `toggle` is shown unconditionally.

I do not know if this is due to [[shortcomming with nested preprocessor directives|todo/nested_preprocessor_directives]] you mentioned in the beginning of this page. Maybe a note could be added to the main page of the plugin. --Paul
