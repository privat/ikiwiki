The plugin depends on [[mdwn]].  If you have
disabled [[mdwn]], to get [[shortcut]] work, you need
commit in a shortcuts.ext (ext is `rcs|creole|html|txt|etc`),
and edit/patch [[shortcut]].

Maybe use the `default_pageext` is better than hardcode .mdwn?

Instead of modifying the [[basewiki]]'s [[shortcuts]] file for local needs --
thus copying it at some point and losing continuity with upstream enhancements --
what about handling a `shortcuts-local.mdwn` or `shortcuts/local.mdwn` (if such
a file exists in the wiki), and additionally process that one.  Possibily a
conditional `\[[!inline]]` could be used.  --[[tschwinge]]
