[[!tag type/auth]]

This plugin allows users to use their [OpenID](http://openid.net/) to log
into the wiki.

The plugin needs the [[!cpan Net::OpenID::Consumer]] perl module.
Version 1.x is needed in order for OpenID v2 to work.

The [[!cpan LWPx::ParanoidAgent]] perl module is used if available, for
added security. Finally, the [[!cpan Crypt::SSLeay]] perl module is needed
to support users entering "https" OpenID urls.

This plugin has a configuration option. You can set `--openidsignup`
to the url of a third-party site where users can sign up for an OpenID. If
it's set, the signin page will link to that site.

This plugin supports the
[myopenid.com affiliate program](http://myopenid.com/affiliate_welcome),
which can be used to help users sign up for an OpenID and log into your
site in a single, unified process. When you create the affiliate, specify a
login url like `http://example.com/ikiwiki.cgi?do=continue`. Once the
affiliate is created, set `openidsignup` to point to the affiliate's signup
url.

This plugin is enabled by default, but can be turned off if you want to
only use some other form of authentication, such as [[passwordauth]].
