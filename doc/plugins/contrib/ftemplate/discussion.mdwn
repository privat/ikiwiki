I initially thought this wasn't actually necessary - the combination
of [[plugins/template]] with [[plugins/contrib/field]]'s `pagetemplate`
hook ought to provide the same functionality. However, `template`
doesn't run `pagetemplate` hooks; a more general version of this
plugin would be to have a variant of `template` that runs `pagetemplate`
hooks (probably easiest to just patch `template` to implement a
second directive, or have a special parameter `run_hooks="yes"`,
or something).

> I got the impression that `pagetemplate` hooks are intended to be completely independent of `template` variables; page-template is for the actual `page.tmpl` template, while `template` is for other templates which are used inside the page content.  So I don't understand why one would need a run_hooks option. --[[KathrynAndersen]]

Another missing thing is that `ftemplate` looks in
the "system" templates directories, not just in the wiki, but that
seems orthogonal (and might be a good enhancement to `template` anyway).
