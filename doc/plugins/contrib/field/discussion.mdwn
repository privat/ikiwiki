Having tried out `field`, some comments (from [[smcv]]):

The general concept looks great.

The `pagetemplate` hook seems quite namespace-polluting: on a site containing
a list of books, I'd like to have an `author` field, but that would collide
with IkiWiki's use of `<TMPL_VAR AUTHOR>` for the author of the *page*
(i.e. me). Perhaps it'd be better if the pagetemplate hook was only active for
`<TMPL_VAR FIELD_AUTHOR>` or something? (For those who want the current
behaviour, an auxiliary plugin would be easy.)

> No, please.  The idea is to be *able* to override field names if one wishes to, and choose, for yourself, non-colliding field names if one wishes not to.  I don't wish to lose the power of being able to, say, define a page title with YAML format if I want to, or to write a site-specific plugin which calculates a page title, or other nifty things.
>It's not like one is going to lose the fields defined by the meta plugin; if "author" is defined by \[[!meta author=...]] then that's what will be found by "field" (provided the "meta" plugin is registered; that's what the "field_register" option is for).

From a coding style point of view, the `$CamelCase` variable names aren't
IkiWiki style, and the `match_foo` functions look as though they could benefit
from being thin wrappers around a common `&IkiWiki::Plugin::field::match`
function (see `meta` for a similar approach).

I think the documentation would probably be clearer in a less manpage-like
and more ikiwiki-like style?

> I don't think ikiwiki *has* a "style" for docs, does it?  So I followed the Perl Module style. And I'm rather baffled as to why having the docs laid out in clear sections... make them less clear. --[[KathrynAndersen]]

If one of my branches from [[todo/allow_plugins_to_add_sorting_methods]] is
accepted, a `field()` cmp type would mean that [[plugins/contrib/report]] can
stop reimplementing sorting. Here's the implementation I'm using, with
your "sortspec" concept (a sort-hook would be very similar): if merged,
I think it should just be part of `field` rather than a separate plugin.

Disclaimer: I've only looked at this plugin and ymlfront, not other related
stuff yet. (I quite like ymlfront, so I looked at this as its dependency. :)
I also don't want to annoy you with a lot of design discussion 
if your main goal was to write a plugin that did exactly what you wanted.

My first question is: Why we need another plugin storing metadata
about the page, when we already have the meta plugin? Much of the
complication around the field plugin has to do with it accessing info
belonging to the meta plugin, and generalizing that to be able to access
info stored by other plugins too. (But I don't see any other plugins that
currently store such info). Then too, it raises points of confusion like
smcv's discuission of field author vs meta author above. --[[Joey]] 

> The point is exactly in the generalization, to provide a uniform interface for accessing structured data, no matter what the source of it, whether that be the meta plugin or some other plugin.

> There were a few reasons for this:

>1. In converting my site over from PmWiki, I needed something that was equivalent to PmWiki's Page-Text-Variables (which is how PmWiki implements structured data).
>2. I also wanted an equivalent of PmWiki's Page-Variables, which, rather than being simple variables, are the return-value of a function.  This gives one a lot of power, because one can do calculations, derive one thing from another.  Heck, just being able to have a "basename" variable is useful.
>3. I noticed that in the discussion about structured data, it was mired down in disagreements about what form the structured data should take; I wanted to overcome that hurdle by decoupling the form from the content.
>4. I actually use this to solve (1), because, while I do use ymlfront, initially my pages were in PmWiki format (I wrote (another) unreleased plugin which parses PmWiki format) including PmWiki's Page-Text-Variables for structured data.  So I needed something that could deal with multiple formats.

> So, yes, it does cater to mostly my personal needs, but I think it is more generally useful, also.

>>>>> Mind you, for trusted sources, since the person writing the page template and the person providing the variable are the same, they themselves would know whether the value will be treated as HTML, plain text, or a URL, and thus could do the needed escaping themselves when writing down the value.

>>>>> * **Needs to be HTML-escaped:** TITLE
>>>>> * **Used as-is (as HTML):** FEEDLINKS, RELVCS, META, PERCENTTRANSLATED, SEARCHFORM, COMMENTSLINK, DISCUSSIONLINK, OTHERLANGUAGES->PERCENT, SIDEBAR, CONTENT, COMMENTS, TAGS->LINK, COPYRIGHT, LICENSE, MTIME, EXTRAFOOTER

>>>>> This looks as if only TITLE needs HTML-escaping all the time, and that the URLS all end with "URL" in their name.  Unfortunately the FAVICON and LOCAL_CSS which are part of URLS don't have "URL" in their name, though that's fair enough, since they aren't full URLs.

Some things, like TITLE, probably should have ESCAPE=HTML all the time; that would solve the "to escape or not to escape" problem that `meta` has with titles. After all, when one *sorts* by title, one doesn't really want HTML-escaping in it; only when one uses it in a template. -- K.A.

>>>>> Something similar is already done in `template` and `ftemplate` with the `raw_` prefix, which determines whether the variable should have `htmlize` run over it first before the value is applied to the template.  Of course, that isn't scrubbing or escaping, because with those templates, the scrubbing is done afterwards as part of the normal processing.
