The `mailbox` plugin adds support to ikiwiki for 
rendering mailbox file into a page displaying the mails
in the mailbox. It supports mbox, maildir, and MH folders,
does threading, and deals with MIME.

One hitch I noticed was that it is not currently possible to treat a
maildir or an MH directory as a page (i.e. just call it foo.mh and have it
transformed to page foo). I'm not sure if this is possible and worthwhile
to fix. It is certainly workable to use a [[!mailbox ]] directive.

This plugin is not in ikiwiki yet, but can be downloaded
from <http://pivot.cs.unb.ca/git/ikimailbox.git>
