Wow, this plugin does a lot... it seems to be `inline` (but without the feeds
or the ability to not have `archive="yes"`), plus part of
[[plugins/contrib/trail]], plus some sorting, plus an ingenious workaround
for template evaluation being relatively stateless.

A large part of this plugin would just fall off if one of the versions of
"[[todo/allow_plugins_to_add_sorting_methods]]" was merged, which was a
large part of the idea of that feature request :-) To make use of that
you'd have to use `pagespec_match_list` in the trail case too, but that's
easy enough - just add `list => [@the_trail_pages]` to the arguments.

Another large part would fall off if this plugin required, and internally
invoked, `inline` (like my `comments` plugin does) - `inline` runs
`pagetemplate` hooks, and in particular, it'll run the `field` hook.
Alternatively, this plugin could invoke `pagetemplate` hooks itself,
removing the special case for `field`.

Perhaps the `headers` thing could migrate into inline somehow? That might
lead to making inline too big, though.

Is the intention that the `trail` part is a performance hack, or a way
to select pages? How does it relate to [[todo/wikitrails]] or
[[plugins/contrib/trail]]? --[[smcv]]

> The `trail` part is *both* a performance hack, and a way to select pages.  I have over 5000 pages on my site, I need all the performance hacks I can get.
> For the performance hack, it is a way of reducing the need to iterate through every single page in the wiki in order to find matching pages.
> For the way-to-select-pages, yes, it is intended to be similar to [[todo/wikitrails]] and [[plugins/contrib/trail]] (and will be more similar with the new release which will be happening soon; it will add prev_* and next_* variables).
