## NAME

IkiWiki::Plugin::xslt - ikiwiki directive to process an XML file with XSLT

## SYNOPSIS

\[[!xslt file="data1.xml" stylesheet="style1.xsl"]]

## DESCRIPTION

IkiWiki::Plugin::xslt is an IkiWiki plugin implementing a directive
to process an input XML data file with XSLT, and output the result in
the page where the directive was called.

It is expected that the XSLT stylesheet will output valid HTML markup.

## OPTIONS

There are two arguments to this directive.

* **file:**
  The file which contains XML data to be processed. This file *must* have a `.xml` extension (`filename.xml`). This file is searched for using the usual IkiWiki mechanism, thus finding the file first in the same directory as the page, then in the directory above, and so on.

* **stylesheet:**
  The file which contains XSLT stylesheet to apply to the XML data.  This file *must* have a `.xsl` extension (`filename.xsl`). This file is searched for using the usual IkiWiki mechanism, thus finding the file first in the same directory as the page, then in the directory above, and so on.
