It seems like the filter 'postal-accept.pl' I wrote doesn't refresh thoroughly enough.  When a comment is added  it calls

         IkiWiki::add_depends($page,$comments_page);

And then after adding the actual comment, it ends with

         IkiWiki::refresh();
         IkiWiki::saveindex();

Sure enough, the page being commented on is refreshed, but not any inline pages (e.g. tags pages, blog top level) that contain it.
Is there a way to recursively refresh? Or should it work that way by default. I guess it is some part of the api that I don't understand, 
since I think not many people grub about in the internals of ikiwiki this way.
It would be nice to figure this out, doing a full rebuild every time I get a blog comment is not that fun.
