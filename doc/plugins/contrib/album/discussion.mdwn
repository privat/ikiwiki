thanks for this plugin.  it might help me in my application, which is to provide album/galleries which can be edited (ie. new images added, taken away, etc.) through web interface.

i have two challenges: firstly, for installation, i'm not sure what all the files are that need to be downloaded (because of my setup i can't easily pull the repo).  so far i have Ikiwiki/Plugins/album.pm; ikiwiki-album; and 4 files in templates/  any others?

secondly: barring the CGI interface for editing the album, which would be great, is there at least a way to use attachment plugin or any other to manually add images and then create viewers for them?

> Images are just attachments, and viewers are pages (any supported

> \[[!albumimage]] directive (usually it will *only* contain that
> directive).

> the CGI interface written), but it should already be possible!

> 
> * album.mdwn (contains the \[[!album]] directive, and perhaps also
>   some \[[!albumsection]] directives)
> * album/a.jpg
> * album/a.html (contains the \[[!albumimage]] directive for a.jpg)
> * album/b.jpg
> * album/b.html (contains the \[[!albumimage]] directive for b.jpg)

i'm new to ikiwiki, apologies if this is dealt with elsewhere.  -brush
