[[!tag type/chrome patch]]

Available from [[smcv]]'s git repository, in the `trail` branch. This
plugin aims to solve [[todo/wikitrails]] in a simpler way.

Joey: what do you think of this plugin? If you like the general approach
and are likely to include it in ikiwiki, I'll try to modify
[[plugins/contrib/album]] to be based on it, rather than partially
reinventing it.

This plugin can benefit from
[[another_of_my_branches|todo/inline_plugin:_specifying_ordered_page_names]]
but does not require it.

It's sometimes useful to have "trails" of pages in a wiki, as a guided
tour, sequence of chapters etc. In this plugin, a trail is represented
by a page, and the pages in the trail are indicated by specially marked
links within that page.

If using the default `page.tmpl`, each page automatically displays the
trails that it's a member of (if any), with links to the trail and to
the next and previous members.

The `traillink` [[ikiwiki/directive]] is used to record which pages
are in a trail, and simultaneously link to them. Alternatively, the
[[ikiwiki/directive/inline]] directive can be used with `trail=yes`
to record the inlined pages as part of the trail, in the order in
which they are inlined.

## Directives

(These will go to the appropriate pages in [[ikiwiki/directive]] if this
plugin is included in ikiwiki.)

### traillink

The `traillink` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/contrib/trail desc=trail]]
plugin. This directive appears on the page representing a trail. It acts
as a visible [[ikiwiki/WikiLink]], but also records the linked page as
a member of the trail.

Various syntaxes can be used:

    \[[!traillink Badgers]]
    \[[!traillink How_to_find_mushrooms_using_badgers|badgers]]
    \[[!traillink badgers text="How to find mushrooms using badgers"]]

### trailoptions

The `trailoptions` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/contrib/trail desc=trail]]
plugin. This directive appears on the page representing a trail, and
produces no output.

Currently, the only option supported is `[[!trailoptions circular=yes]]`,
which adds links between the first and last pages, turning the trail into
a circle.
