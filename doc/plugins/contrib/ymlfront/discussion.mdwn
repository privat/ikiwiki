My field-etc branch in git://git.pseudorandom.co.uk/git/smcv/ikiwiki.git (gitweb:
<http://git.pseudorandom.co.uk/smcv/ikiwiki.git?a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/field-etc>)
has some fixes for compatibility with old YAML modules, mostly done by imitating
Joey's code in IkiWiki::Setup::Yaml. Please consider merging :-) --[[smcv]]

> I would if I could *find* it.  I checked out the "field-etc" branch, but I can't find the plugins in question under IkiWiki/Plugin; am I looking in the wrong place, or what?
