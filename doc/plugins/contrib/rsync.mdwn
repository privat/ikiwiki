This plugin allows ikiwiki to push generated pages to another host
by running a command such as `rsync`.

### Usage
7. Enable automated SSH key exchange between ikiwiki and the remote
   host. [keychain](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/keychain/) makes
   it easy to use a passphrase-protected key for this purpose. It's
   also a good idea to specify the exact command line to be permitted
   in the remote host's `$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
7. Set `rsync_command` in your setup file. If you're using a
   passphrase-protected key, then set `rsync_command` to a shell
   script which reads `keychain`'s current state before calling
   `rsync`.

### Implementation details
* The plugin relies on a new "postrefresh" hook called at the very end of
  `IkiWiki/Render.pm:refresh()`.
