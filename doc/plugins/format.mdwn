This plugin allows mixing different page formats together, by embedding
text formatted one way inside a page formatted another way. This is done
using the [[ikiwiki/directive/format]] [[ikiwiki/directive]].

For example, it could be used to embed an [[otl]] outline inside a page
that is formatted as [[mdwn]].
