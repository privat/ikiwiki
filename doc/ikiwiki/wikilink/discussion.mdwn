# Creating an anchor in Markdown

Is it a native Markdown "tag" for creating an anchor? Unfortunately,
I haven't any information about it at
[Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) page.

Of course, I know that I can use HTML tag to do it,
for example &lt;a name="foo" /&gt;, but I don't want to mix Markdown
and HTML code if it's not necessary.

BTW, ikiwiki doesn't displays the #foo anchor in the example
("To link to an anchor inside a page...") at [[WikiLink]] page...

Considering a hierarchy like `foo/bar/bar`, I had the need to link from the
`foo/bar/bar` page to the `foo/bar` one.  It would have been convenient to
simply write [[wikilink]]s like `\[[../bar]]` (or even just `\[[..]]`?), but
this doesn't work, so I had to resort to using `\[[foo/bar]]` instead.

How do I make images clickable?  The obvious guess, \[[foo.png|/index]], doesn't work.  --[[sabr]]

Is it possible to refer to a page, say \[[foobar]], such that the link text is taken from foobar's title [[directive/meta]] tag? --Peter

> Not yet. :-) Any suggestion for a syntax for it? Maybe something like \[[|foobar]] ? --[[Joey]]

I like your suggestion because it's short and conscise. However, it would be nice to be able to refer to more or less arbitrary meta tags in links, not just "title". To do that, the link needs two parameters: the page name and the tag name, i.e. \[[pagename!metatag]]. Any sufficiently weird separater can be used instead of '!', of course. I like \[[pagename->metatag]], too, because it reminds me of accessing a data member of a structure (which is what referencing a meta tag is, really). --Peter
