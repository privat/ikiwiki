Some [[directives|ikiwiki/directive]] that use
[[PageSpecs|ikiwiki/pagespec]] allow
specifying the order that matching pages are shown in. The following sort
orders can be specified.

* `age` - List pages from the most recently created to the oldest.

* `mtime` - List pages with the most recently modified first.

* `title` - Order by title (page name).
[[!if test="enabled(sortnaturally)" then="""
* `title_natural` - Orders by title, but numbers in the title are treated
  as such, ("1 2 9 10 20" instead of "1 10 2 20 9")
"""]]
[[!if test="enabled(meta)" then="""
* `meta(title)` - Order according to the `\[[!meta title="foo" sortas="bar"]]`
  or `\[[!meta title="foo"]]` [[ikiwiki/directive]], or the page name if no
  full title was set. `meta(author)`, `meta(date)`, `meta(updated)`, etc.
  also work.
"""]]

In addition, you can combine several sort orders and/or reverse the order of
sorting, with a string like `age -title` (which would sort by age, then by
title in reverse order if two pages have the same age).

[[!meta robots="noindex, follow"]]
