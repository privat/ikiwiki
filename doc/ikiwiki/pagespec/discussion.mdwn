I am using ikiwiki 2.6.1.

I can't figure out the locked pages.

As an admin in preferences, I put in my Locked Pages:

index and downloads

I don't want anyone to be able to edit the front page or my downloads page.

That didn't work. I am using a different web browser as a different non-ikiwiki-admin user.

So I changed it to

/index and /downloads

That stopped me from editing the front page. It didn't say it was locked just repeatedly gave me the ikiwiki login. (How can I get it to tell me it is locked instead?)

I also tried

/index and /downloads/index

But I could still edit my downloads page.

Can someone share some hints on how to lock these two pages?

My source pages for the lock are:

source/downloads.mdwn
source/index.mdwn

My webpages to lock are:

public\_html/downloads/index.html
public\_html/index.html

I have a page for a tag.  On that page I want to list every page on my wiki that has been so tagged.  Easy enough, right?

> \[[!inline pages="link(Categories/Ikiwiki_Plugins)" feeds=no archive=yes sort=title template=titlepage]]

> (I'm using tagbase => "Categories" because I'm converting from Mediawiki) 

This works beautifully in my sandbox: <http://iki.u32.net/sandbox>  But it is totally blank on the page where I actually do want output!  <http://iki.u32.net/Categories/Ikiwiki_Plugins>

How can I fix this?  --[[sabr]]

Should negation work with user(), with locked_pages in setup?  I
experimented with setting locked_pages => 'user(someuser)' and was able to
edit as a different user.  However, setting locked_pages =>
'!user(someuser)' doesn't seem to allow edits for only 'someuser' - it
locks out all users.

Is there a way to refer to all subpages of the current page, if  the name of the 
current page is not known (i.e. the pagespec is used in a template)? The ./ syntax
does not seem suitable for this, as

> \[[!map pages="./*"]]

also lists the current page and all its siblings.

I'm about to post [[bugs/pagespec can't match {curly} braces]]. --Ivan Z.
