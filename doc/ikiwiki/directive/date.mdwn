The `date` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/date desc=date]] plugin.

This directive can be used to display a date on a page, using the same
display method that is used to display the modification date in the page
footer, and other dates in the wiki. This can be useful for consistency
of display, or if you want to embed parseable dates into the page source.

Like the dates used by the [[meta]] directive, the date can be entered in
nearly any format, since it's parsed by [[!cpan TimeDate]].

For example, an update to a page with an embedded date stamp could look
like:

	Updated \[[!date "Wed, 25 Nov 2009 01:11:55 -0500"]]: mumble mumble

[[!meta robots="noindex, follow"]]
