## How do you provide the per post discussion links in your own blog?

And do you have any ideas/hints about implementing a "comments" feature.
What I'm after is something for users who don't quite understand the Wiki
style for discussions.  I would like to have a form for them to post a
comment and have the comment appended to the discussion Wiki-style.  Maybe
take it as far as implementing "replies" to other comments.

## Excluding Images

Is there a simple way to exclude images, stylesheets, and other
"non-page" files other than a blacklist approach like
`pages="* and !*.png and !*.css"`?  --[[JasonBlevins]]

## Documentation for parameter `template`?

I would be especially interested in a list of variables which can be used in such a template.

I have a page template with some structured information as parameters. For example `location="nowhere"` and `price="20"`. Is there a possibility to extract those information, i. e. access the parameters, to compose the item for the inline directive from these information? For example the line »Go to nowhere for 20 bugs.« is shown inlined.
