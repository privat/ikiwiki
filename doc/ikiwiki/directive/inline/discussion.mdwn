And do you have any ideas/hints about implementing a "comments" feature.
What I'm after is something for users who don't quite understand the Wiki
style for discussions.  I would like to have a form for them to post a
comment and have the comment appended to the discussion Wiki-style.  Maybe
take it as far as implementing "replies" to other comments.

## More dynamic `rootpage` parameter of inline plugin?

## Excluding Images

Is there a simple way to exclude images, stylesheets, and other
"non-page" files other than a blacklist approach like
`pages="* and !*.png and !*.css"`?  --[[JasonBlevins]]

## Documentation for parameter `template`?

I would be especially interested in a list of variables which can be used in such a template.

I have a page template with some structured information as parameters. For
example `location="nowhere"` and `price="20"`. Is there a possibility to
extract those information, i. e. access the parameters, to compose the item
for the inline directive from these information? For example the line »Go
to nowhere for 20 bugs.« is shown inlined.

## meta parameters are not enough

I think I have the same problem as Paule, as I want extra arbitary parameters in my template.

This is what I am doing currently, which makes my skin crawl. In `wgts/foo.mdwn`
I have resorted to using AUTHORURL as the location of this widgets icon:

	[[!meta authorurl="/ico/aHR0cDovL2JvbmRpLm9tdHAub3JnL3dpZGdldHMvYmF0dGVyeQ==.png" ]]

In templates I have a file called `wgtlist.tmpl`:

	<div class="widget">
	<TMPL_IF NAME="AUTHORURL">
	<img src="<TMPL_VAR AUTHORURL>" />
	</TMPL_IF>
	<TMPL_IF NAME="PERMALINK">
	<a href="<TMPL_VAR PERMALINK>"><TMPL_VAR TITLE></a><br />
	<TMPL_ELSE>
	<a href="<TMPL_VAR PAGEURL>"><TMPL_VAR TITLE></a><br />
	</TMPL_IF>
	Posted <TMPL_VAR CTIME>
	</div>

My index page has:

	[[!inline pages="./wgts/*" show=5 feeds=no actions=no rootpage="wgts" archive="yes" template=wgtlist]]

Else can you please suggest a smarter way of getting certain data out from pages for a inline index?

## Interaction of `show` and `feedshow`

Reading the documentation I would think that `feedshow` does not
influence `show`.

	\[[!inline pages="./blog/*" archive=yes quick=yes feedshow=10 sort=title reverse=yes]]

Only ten pages are listed in this example although `archive` is set to
yes. Removing `feedshow=10` all matching pages are shown.

Is that behaviour intended?

--[[PaulePanter]]

>> Bug was that if feedshow was specified without show it limited to it incorrectly. Fixed. --[[Joey]]
