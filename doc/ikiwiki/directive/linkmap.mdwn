The `linkmap` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/linkmap desc=linkmap]] plugin.

This directive uses [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) to generate a
graph showing the links between a set of pages in the wiki. Example usage:

	\[[!linkmap pages="* and !blog/* and !*/Discussion"]]

Only links between mapped pages will be shown; links pointing to or from
unmapped pages will be omitted. If the pages to include are not specified,
the links between all pages (and other files) in the wiki are mapped. For
best results, only a small set of pages should be mapped, since otherwise
the map can become very large, unwieldy, and complicated. Also, the map is
rebuilt whenever one of the mapped pages is changed, which can make the
wiki a bit slow.

Here are descriptions of all the supported parameters to the `linkmap`
directive:

* `pages` - A [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] of the pages to map.
* `height`, `width` - Limit the size of the map to a given height and width,
  in inches. Both must be specified for the limiting to take effect, otherwise
  the map's size is not limited.
