The `toc` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/toc desc=toc]] plugin.

Add a table of contents to a page:

	\[[!toc ]]

The table of contents will be automatically generated based on the
headers of the page. By default only the largest headers present on the
page will be shown; to control how many levels of headers are shown, use
the `levels` parameter:

	\[[!toc levels=2]]

The toc directive will take the level of the first header as the topmost
level, even if there are higher levels seen later in the file.

To create a table of contents that only shows headers starting with a given
level, use the `startlevel` parameter. For example, to show only h2 and
smaller headers:

	\[[!toc startlevel=2]]

The table of contents will be created as an ordered list. If you want
an unordered list instead, you can change the list-style in your local
style sheet.

[[!meta robots="noindex, follow"]]
