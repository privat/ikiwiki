If searching is enabled, you can enter search terms in the search field,
as you'd expect. There are a few special things you can do to construct
more powerful searches.

* To match a phrase, enclose it in double quotes.
* `AND` can be used to search for documents containing two expressions.
* `OR` can be used to search for documents containing either one of
  two expressions.
* Parentheses can be used to build up complicated search expressions. For
  example, "(foo AND bar) OR (me AND you)"
* Prefix a search term with "-" to avoid it from appearing in the results.
  For example, "-discussion" will omit "discussion".
* To search for a page with a given title, use "title:foo".
* To search for pages that contain a "bar" link, use "link:bar".
