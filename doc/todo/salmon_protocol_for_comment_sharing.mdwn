The <a href="http://www.salmon-protocol.org/home">Salmon protocol</a>
provides for aggregating comments across sites.  If a site that syndicates
a feed receives a comment on an item in that feed, it can re-post the
comment to the original source.

> Ikiwiki does not allow comments to be posted on items it aggregates.
> So salmon protocol support would only need to handle the comment
> receiving side of the protocol.

> The current draft protocol document confuses me when it starts talking
> about using OAuth in the abuse prevention section, since their example
> does not show use of OAuth, and it's not at all clear to me where the
> OAuth relationship between aggregator and original source is supposed
> to come from.
