It would be nice if the [[plugins/toc]] plugin let you specify a header level "ceiling" above which (or above and including which) the headers would not be incorporated into the toc.

Currently, the levels=X parameter lets you tweak how deep it will go for small headers, but I'd like to chop off the h1's (as I use them for my page title) -- [[Jon]]
