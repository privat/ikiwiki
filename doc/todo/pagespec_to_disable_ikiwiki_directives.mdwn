I would like some pages (identified by pagespec) to not expand ikiwiki directives (wikilinks, or \[[!, or both, or perhaps either).

I will tag this [[wishlist]]. It's something I might try myself. It's part of my thinking about how to handle [[comments]], as I'm still ruminating on alternatives to [[smcv]]'s approach. (with the greatest of respect to smcv!) (Perhaps my attempt will try to factor out the no-directives-allowed logic from the comments plugin).
