Currently, new comments are named with an incrementing ID (comment_N). So
if a wiki has multiple disconnected servers, and comments are made to the
same page on both, merging is guaranteed to result in conflicts.

I propose avoiding such merge problems by naming a comment with a sha1sum
of its (full) content. Keep the incrementing ID too, so there is an
-ordering. And so duplicate comments are allowed..)
So, "comment_N_SHA1".

Note: The comment body will need to use meta title in the case where no 
title is specified, to retain the current behavior of the default title
being "comment N".
