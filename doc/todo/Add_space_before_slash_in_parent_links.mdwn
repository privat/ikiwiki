This [[patch]] adds a space before the forward-slash in the the parent links. There is already a space after the slash.

> I intentionally put the space after the slash and not before, because I
> like how it looks that way. So I don't plan to apply this patch unless a
> lot of people disagree with me or whatever. --[[Joey]]

>> Couldn't we export what's put between the links to a variable? For instance, I might actually want to set it to ' : ' or 'â†’'. --[[madduck]]

>>> Yes, please.  This seems to be something a lot of people want to customize.  (I certainly do -- a forward slash only looks natural to Unix users)  --[[sabr]]

>> Joey, would I be right to summarize your position on this as "people who

>> closed in a way acceptable to you, except perhaps as WONTFIX. --[[smcv]]

----

It's almost implicit in some of the discussion above but this can be achieved locally if you fork your templates directory from ikiwiki's, with an ammendment such as

    <h1><TMPL_LOOP NAME="PARENTLINKS"><a
        href="<TMPL_VAR NAME=URL>"><TMPL_VAR NAME=PAGE></a>
        &rarr;
        </TMPL_LOOP><TMPL_VAR TITLE></h1>

This is what I do on my site for example. -- [[Jon]]
