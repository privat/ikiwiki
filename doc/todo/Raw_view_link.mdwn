I'd like to have a "raw view" link to view the source for the current page. It would go with the history link that each page has.

The configuration setting for Mercurial could be something like this:

    rawurl => "http://localhost:8000//raw-file/tip/\[[file]]",

> What I do when I want to see if the raw source is either
> click on the edit link, or click on history and navigate to it in the
> history browser (easier to do in viewvc than in gitweb, IIRC).
> Not that I'm opposed to the idea of a plugin that adds a Raw link
