[[Wishlist]] item: I'd love to see the ability to optionally switch back to
wiki syntax within the comments of code pretty-printed with the
[[plugins/contrib/syntax]] plugin.  This would allow the use of links and
formatting in comments.

> You can do this using the [[plugins/highlight]] plugin, but you have
> to explicitly put a format directive in the comment to do it. Thus,
> I'm leaving this open for now.. ideally, comments would be detected,
> and formatted as markdown. --[[Joey]]
