A [[patch]] in my git repository (the inline-pagenames branch) adds the following
parameter to the [[ikiwiki/directive/inline]] directive:

> * `pagenames` - If given instead of `pages`, this is interpreted as a
>    space-separated list of links to pages (with the same
>   [[ikiwiki/SubPage/LinkingRules]] as in a [[ikiwiki/WikiLink]]), and they are inlined
>   in exactly the order given: the `sort` and `pages` parameters cannot be used
>   in conjunction with this one.

This is on my [[wishlist]] for my [[plugins/contrib/album]] plugin, which currently
uses it internally (as it has already collected the pages in order). It could also
be useful for other things, like [[todo/wikitrails]]. --[[smcv]]
