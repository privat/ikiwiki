Please don't shoot me for asking:

Could we have an ikiwiki mailing list?

Here's an example use case:
I want to discuss building a feature. Such discussion could happen on the wiki, but I would prefer to---at the least---be able to email ikiwiki developers and ask them to participate in this particular discussion.

Does this sound okay?

>>I was going to make the very same request, so I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who felt the need for it.

>>I can see your reasoning, though I don't think ikiwiki has reached the level (yet) of facilitating discussion as well as a mailing list does.
>>You've already pointed out the need for (a) more structured discussion pages, (b) comments sent via mail, but I'm not sure whether that will be enough. This is because the nature of a wiki means that discussions are scattered all over the site, as people discuss in discussion pages about the given topic - and so they should.  The consequence of this, however, is that one has a choice (in regard to RSS feeds) of having too much or too little.  Too little, if one only feeds on news/todo/bugs/forum, since one misses out on discussions elsewhere.  Too much, because the only other option appears to be subscribing to recentchanges, which will give one *everything*, whether it is relevant or not.
>>Unfortunately, I'm not really sure what the best solution is for this problem.

>> For those who might be interested, I've added the following RSS feeds to <http://www.dreamwidth.org>:
*ikiwiki_bugs_feed,
ikiwiki_forum_feed,
ikiwiki_news_feed,
ikiwiki_recent_feed,
ikiwiki_todo_feed,
ikiwiki_wishlist_feed*
