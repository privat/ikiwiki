It would be nice to specify a minimum length for the change log for web edits, and if it's only required vs. non-required. I realise this is not going to solve the problem of crap log messages, but it helps guard against accidental submissions which one would have logged. Mediawiki/wikipedia has that option, and I find it a useful reminder. --[[madduck]]
