<http://khjk.org/~pesco/ikiwiki-darcs/> (now a darcs repo)

I've taken all the good stuff from the above (now deleted --[[Joey]]) and added the missing hooks. The code hasn't seen a lot of testing, so some bugs are likely yet to surface. Also, I'm not experienced with perl and don't know where I should have used the function `possibly_foolish_untaint`.

> Review of this one:

> * Should use tab indentation. (fixed)

>   once per page, ever, and the data is cached in ikiwiki's index. (fixed)

> * I don't understand what `darcs_info` is doing, but it seems to be
>   parsing xml with a regexp?
> * Looks like `rcs_commit` needs a few improvements, as marked TODO
> * `rcs_remove` just calls unlink? Does darcs record notice the file was removed

> * Is the the darcs info in [[rcs/details]] still up-to-date re this version? (fixed)

I've finally merged this into ikiwiki master. The plugin looks quite
complete, with only the new `rcs_receive` hook missing, and I
hope it works as good as it looks. :) If anyone wants to work on improving
it, there are some TODOs as mentioned above that could still be improved.
