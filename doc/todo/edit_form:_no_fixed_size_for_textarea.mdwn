At the moment the text area in the edit form has a fixed size of 20 rows.

On longer pages its not very comfortable to edit pages with such a small box. The whole screen size should be used instead([example](http://img3.imagebanana.com/img/bl10u9mb/editingtodo_1241804460828.png)).

>>>>>> the javascript approach would need to work something like this: you need to know about the "bottom-most" item on the edit page, and get a handle for that object in the DOM. You can then obtain the absolute position height-wise of this element and the absolute position of the bottom of the window to determine the pixel-difference. Then, you set the height of the textarea to (current height in px) + determined-value. This needs to be re-triggered on various resize events, at least for the window and probably for other elements too. I may have a stab at this at some point. -- [[Jon]]
