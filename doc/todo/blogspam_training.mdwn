The [[blogspam plugin|plugins/blogspam]] is just great.

However, it lacks support in the web interface to [train comments as
SPAM](http://blogspam.net/api/classifyComment.html), when they were
erroneously identified as ham.  It would be great to have such
support, also in the spirit of helping
[blogspam.net](http://blogspam.net) to get better and better.

What would consist the most appropriate user interface is not entirely
clear to me in the general case (wiki page editing).  The case of blog
comments look easier to: when the admin user is logged in (and if the
blogspam plugin is enabled), each comment can have an extra link "mark
as SPAM" which would both delete/revert the comment and submit it to
the configured blogspam server for training.

Similarly, ham training can be plugged directly into the current
comment moderation interface. Each comment that gets approved by the
admin, can be sent to blogspam.net as ham. If this is considered too
"aggressive", this behaviour can need to be explicitly enabled by
turning on a configuration option.
