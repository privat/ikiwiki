Here is a patch for the [[plugins/meta]] plugin. It adds the possibility to define the language 
used for a page, with \[[!meta lang="ja"]]

It doesn't insert the langage information in the xhtml meta elements, but defines a LANG
variable to use in the templates, for example with

    <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
          lang="<TMPL_IF NAME="LANG"><TMPL_VAR LANG><TMPL_ELSE>fr</TMPL_IF>"
          xml:lang="<TMPL_IF NAME="LANG"><TMPL_VAR LANG><TMPL_ELSE>fr</TMPL_IF>">

This way also allows to define a language for a subset of the final page, with custom
templates and inclusion. 

This may be useful for sites with a few pages in different languages, but no full i18n.

>> --lang=XX could be a setup option, with a default value, then the template would be 

                <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="<TMPL_VAR LANG>" xml:lang="<TMPL_VAR LANG>">

> Now it just needs to be finished up.. --[[Joey]]
