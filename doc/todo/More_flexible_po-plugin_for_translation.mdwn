I have a website with multi-language content, where some content is only in English, some in German, and some is available in both languages.

The po-module currently has only one master-language, with slave languages, and a  PageSpec should be considered.

It would be nice to flag the content which should have a translation on a file-by-file basis (with some inline directive?) which could contain the information of the master-language for that file and the desired target-languages.
