ikiwiki should be fully internationalized.

----

As to the hardcoded strings in ikiwiki, I've internationalized the program,
and there is a po/ikiwiki.pot in the source that can be translated.

I've revised the patches (tested OK):

- $config{lang} patch:

    <http://people.debian.org/~roktas/patches/ikiwiki/ikiwiki-lang.diff>

  + Support for CGI::FormBuilder.
  + Modify Makefile.PL for l10n.

- l10n infrastructure from Koha project.  (This patch must be applied with
  '-p1', also, it needs a 'chmod +x l10n/*.pl' after patching.)

  + Leave templates dir untouched, use a temporary translations directory
    instead.
  + Fix Makefile (it failed to update templates).

Looks like, tmpl_process3 cannot preserve line breaks in template files.
For example, it processed the following template:

    Someone[1], possibly you, requested that you be emailed the password for
user
    <TMPL_VAR USER_NAME> on <TMPL_VAR WIKINAME>[2].

    The password is: <TMPL_VAR USER_PASSWORD>

    --
    ikiwiki

    [1] The user requesting the password was at IP address <TMPL_VAR
REMOTE_ADDR>
    [2] Located at <TMPL_VAR WIKIURL>

as (in Turkish):

Birisi[1], ki muhtemelen bu sizsiniz, <TMPL_VAR WIKINAME>[2] üzerindeki
<TMPL_VAR USER_NAME> kullanıcısına ait parolanın epostalanması isteğinde
bulundu. Parola: <TMPL_VAR USER_PASSWORD> -- ikiwiki [1] Parolayı isteyen
kullanıcının ait IP adresi: <TMPL_VAR REMOTE_ADDR>[2] <TMPL_VAR WIKIURL>

This could be easily worked around in tmpl_process3, but I wouldn't like to
maintain a separate utility.
