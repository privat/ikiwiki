It might be a good idea to enable --getctime when `.ikiwiki` does not
exist. This way a new checkout of a `srcdir` would automatically get
ctimes right. (Running --getctime whenever a rebuild is done would be too
slow.) --[[Joey]] 

Could this be too annoying in some cases, eg, checking out a large wiki
that needs to get set up right away? --[[Joey]]
