Implementing tags in terms of links is clever, but it would be nice if it was
opaque in both directions: tagging and matching tags. Writing pagespecs to
find out which pages are tagged with a given name means that the pagespec is
tied to whatever the tagbase is.

This patch adds a pagespec function 'tag' which lets you write pagespecs to
match tagged pages independent of whatever the tagbase is set to.
