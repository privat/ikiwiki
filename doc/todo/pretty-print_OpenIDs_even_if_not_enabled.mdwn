A feature I originally requested on
[[a_related_bug|bugs/openid_no_longer_pretty-prints_OpenIDs]]:

    Allow the openid plugin to be loaded but disabled, for its side-effect of defining IkiWiki::openiduser
    
    On various sites I have two IkiWiki instances running from the same
    repository: one accessible via http and only accepting openid logins,
    and one accessible via authenticated https and only accepting httpauth.
    Ideally, the https version should still pretty-print OpenIDs seen in
    git history.
