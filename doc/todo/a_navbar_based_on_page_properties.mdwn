One thing I don't like about Tobi's `navbar.pm` is that the navigation bar is
hardcoded instead of computed from what's available. Obviously, this allows
for a very customised `navbar` (i.e. not making all pages show up, like
a `map` would). However, I think this could also be achieved through page
properties.

So imagine four pages A, B, A/C, and A/D, and these pages would include the
following directives, respectively

    \[[!navbaritem navbar=main priority=3]]
    \[[!navbaritem navbar=main priority=5]]
    \[[!navbaritem navbar=main title="Something else"]]
    \[[!navbaritem navbar=main]]

then one could insert `\[[!navbar id=main maxlevels=0]]` somewhere and it
would get replaced with (this being in the context of viewing page C):

    <ol class="navbar" id="navbar_main">
      <li><a href="../B">B</a></li>
      <li><a href="../A">A</a>
        <ol>
          <li class="current">Something else</li>
          <li><a href="D">D</a></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

B would sort before A because it has a higher priority, but C would sort
before D because their priorities are equal. The overridden title is not used
for sorting.

Also, the code automatically deduces that C and D are second-level under A.

I don't think this is hard to code up and it's what I've been using with
[rest2web](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/rest2web/) and it's served me
well.

There is a problem though if this navbar were included in a sidebar (the logical place): if a page is updated, the navbar needs to be rebuilt which causes the sidebar to be rebuilt, which causes the whole site to be rebuilt. Unless we can subscribe only to title changes, this will be pretty bad...
