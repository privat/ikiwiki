## No return_to in OpenID server

Hi, there's no return_to from a designated OpenID server page, specs requires (I think a "should" or "must", can't recall exact wording) that it redirects back to the RP, in order to complete the registration and authentication. Unless I'm missing something, and the doc is incomplete, I'd consider this a bug. I don't expect to be of much use WRT coming up with a patch, but I'm willing to test ;-) .
