If goto is passed a page name that 
contains spaces or is otherwise not a valid page name,
it will display a "page does not exist", with a create link. But,
clicking on the link will result in "bad page name".

I have found at least two ways it can happen:

* If 404 is enabled, and the user goes to "http://wiki/some page with spaces"
* If mercurial is used, it pulls the user's full name, with spaces,
  out for `rcs_recentchanges` and that ends up on RecentChanges.

When fixing, need to keep in mind that we can't just run the input through
titlepage, since in all other circumstances, the page name is already valid
and we don't want to doubly-encode it.

Seems like the goto plugin needs to check if the page name is valid and
pass it through titlepage if not.

(As a side effect of this, 404 will start redirecting "http://wiki/some page
with spaces" to "http://wiki/some_page_with_spaces", if the latter exists.
That seems like a fairly good thing.)
