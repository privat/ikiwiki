Upgrading to `librpc-xml-perl` 0.69-1 on debian breaks external XML-RPC plugins (such as [[rst]]).
Refresing the wiki fails with an error message like this:

    RPC::XML::Parser::new: This method should have
    been overridden by the RPC::XML::Parser class at
    /usr/share/perl5/RPC/XML/Parser.pm line 46, <GEN1> line 30.

It appears an incompatible change in the library creates this problem.

`librpc-xml-perl` version 0.67-1 works. The easiest solution is to downgrade to this version,
or disable XML-RPC plugins if they are not needed.
