I'm using firefox-3.0.8-alt0.M41.1 (Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4pre) Gecko/2008100921 Firefox/3.0). I have noticed that quite often it shows an old state of a page at http://ikiwiki.info, e.g., [[recentchanges]] without my last edits, or the last page I edited (say, 50 min ago) in the state it was before I edited it.

Only explicitly pressing "reload" helps.

Is it a bug? I haven't been noticing such problems usually on other sites. --Ivan Z.
