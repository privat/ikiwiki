When I click on a linked username for commits on the recentchanges page (on
the live ikiwiki.info) I get a link such as
<http://ikiwiki.info/ikiwiki.cgi?page=users%2Fjoey&do=recentchanges_link>
which returns something like

    <a href="http://ikiwiki.info">ikiwiki</a>/ Error
    <p class="error">Error: unknown do parameter

> That was fixed in 3.04 but ikiwiki.info had not been upgraded to it yet.
