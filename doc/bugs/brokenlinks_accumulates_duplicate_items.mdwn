After several runs of ikiwiki --refresh, the page I use with the [[plugin/brokenlinks]] directive on it accumulates multiple repeated lists of pages on the RHS. For example:

 * ?freebies from free kilowatts, free kilowatts, free kilowatts, free kilowatts, free kilowatts

In this case the page "free kilowatts" has one link to "freebies" (it's tagged freebies).

I think this may just be links caused by tags, actually.

ikiwiki version 3.14159265.

>> Hi Joey, thanks for your response. I've reproduced it post rebuild and after having ran ikiwiki-transition and many refreshes (both resulting from content changes and otherwise) unfortunately, with ikiwiki 3.14159265 (different machine to above report, though). I will contact you privately to provide a git URL and a copy of my .ikiwiki. -- [[Jon]]
