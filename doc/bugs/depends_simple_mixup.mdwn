The [[bugs]] page, at least before I commit this, has a bug at the top that
has been modified to link to done, and ikiwiki's dependency calculations
failed to notice and update the bugs page. Looking at the indexdb, I saw
that the page was not included in the `depends_simple` of the bugs page. 

I was able to replicate the problem locally by starting off with the page
marked done (when it did appear in the bugs page `depends_simple`
(appropriatly as a link dependency, since a change to the page removing the
link would make it match)), then removing the done link. 

At that point, it vanished from `depends_simple`. Presumably because
the main (pagespec) depends for the bugs page now matched it, as a content
dependency. But, it seems to me it should still be listed in
`depends_simple` here. This, I think, is the cause of the bug.

Then re-add the done link, and the dependency calc code breaks down,
not noticing that bugs dependeded on the page and needs to be updated.

Ok.. Turns out this was not a problem with the actual influences
calculation or dependency calculation code. Whew! `match_link`
just didn't set the influence correctly when failing. [[fixed|done]]
