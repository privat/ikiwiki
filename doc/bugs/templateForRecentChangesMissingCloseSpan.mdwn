In the template for ikiwiki's recent changes page

     /usr/share/ikiwiki/templates/change.tmpl

there is a missing </span> tag after the

     <span class="changedate"><TMPL_VAR COMMITDATE>

This results in the recentchanges/ page being invalid and rendering quite horrifyingly in Internet Exploder.

[I'm running](http://wiki.shlrm.org) (linked so you can see the one I'm running if you need to) the latest version of ikiwiki, and I note that it's broken on [ikiwiki.info](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fikiwiki.info%2Frecentchanges%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0&user-agent=W3C_Validator%2F1.767) too :)

[This one on debian](https://www.icanttype.org/recentchanges/) is somehow [valid](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.icanttype.org%2F%2Frecentchanges%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0&user-agent=W3C_Validator%2F1.767), although it's using the same template. Perhaps there's an additional scrubbing going on his end.

Thanks,
David

PS: I have fixed the template by hand on my server, so it will validate, however ikiwiki.info will not.
