The toggle plugins checks for a `<body>` in the page; if not found, javascript tags are inserted at the top of the document. Since my page uses `<body onload="javascript:fixLinks()">`; a plain `<body>` is not found and I get script links before the docstring declaration. Please see the source of the following toggle-using page: http://kaizer.se/wiki/kupfer/ -- ulrik [kaizer.se]
