Although I have comments enabled and I have been using them successfully for ages now, I've come to notice that they have stopped working in the last week or two.

I am running version 3.20100312 with the following configuration:

<http://static.natalian.org/2010-03-27/natalian.txt>

In my (HTML5 modified page.tmpl) it doesn't seem to enter the "TMPL_IF COMMENTS" block anymore. I tried the stock page.tmpl and they didn't seem to work either, so the variable name hasn't changed has it?

Any other ideas? With thanks,

	comments_pagespec => 'archives/* and !*/Discussion',

That's the only place where I want comments. <http://natalian.org/archives/>
Has the pagespec changed? Is it `archives/*/*` or something like that?

It worked just fine with this configuration. I swear I have not modified it. :) -- [[Kai Hendry]]

I have tried rebuilding on my squeeze system and still comments don't appear. Any clues how to debug this?

I was worried is was due to a time skew problem I was experiencing on my VPS in the last month, though the time is right now and still comments do not appear on blog posts like <http://natalian.org/archives/2010/03/25/BBC_News_complaints/>
