The [[plugins/remove]] plugin does not report an error if git rm fails. (It
probably doesn't if other VCS backends fail too). This can happen for example
if a page in your source directory is not a tracked file for whatever reason
(in my case, due to renaming the files and forgetting to commit that change).
