I keep getting:

	Error: Your login session has expired.

Whilst trying to edit http://hugh.vm.bytemark.co.uk/ikiwiki.cgi via OpenID. Any ideas?


	iki@hugh:~$ dpkg -l | grep openid
	ii  libnet-openid-consumer-perl     0.14-4                library for consumers of OpenID iden
	tities
	iki@hugh:~$

Thanks for you excellent analysis. The bug was due to old pre-3.0 **templates** laying about. After deleting them, ikiwiki defaults to its own templates. Clever. :-)

Great, this saved me big time! It is a google 1st hit. I had the same with accidentally using old templates. Thanks! --[[cstamas]]
