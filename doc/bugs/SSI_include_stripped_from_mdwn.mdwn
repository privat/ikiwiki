If I have a &lt;--#include virtual="foo" --&gt; in some file, it gets stripped, even though other HTML comments don't get stripped. I imagine it's some plugin doing it, or IkiWiki itself, or an IkiWiki dependency, but I haven't found where this is happening. I'm trying to implement a workaround for my sidebars forcing a rebuild of the wiki every day - I use the calendar plugin - when the day changes, by using SSI.
