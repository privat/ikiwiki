The git commit (in my `openid` branch) says it all:

    Update IkiWiki::openiduser to work with Net::OpenID 2.x
    
    openiduser previously used a constructor that no longer works in 2.x.
    However, all we actually want is the (undocumented) DisplayOfURL function
    that is invoked by the display method, so try to use that.

This bug affects ikiwiki.info (my commits show up in [[RecentChanges]] as http://smcv.pseudorandom.co.uk/ rather than smcv [pseudorandom.co.uk]).

Relatedly, the other commit on the same branch would be nice to have
(edited to add: I've now moved it, and its discussion, to
[[todo/pretty-print_OpenIDs_even_if_not_enabled]]). --[[smcv]]
