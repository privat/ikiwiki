It may be that I'm simply misunderstanding something, but what is the rationale
for having `tagged()` also match normal wikilinks?

> It simply hasn't been implemented yet -- see the answer in [[todo/tag_pagespec_function]]. Tags and wikilinks share the same underlying implementation, although ab reasonable expectation is that they are kept separate. --Ivan Z.

The following situation.  I have `tagbase => 'tag'`.  On some pages, scattered
over the whole wiki, I use `\[[!tag open_issue_gdb]]` to declare that this page
contains information about an open issue with GDB.  Then, I have a page
`/tag/open_issues_gdb.mdwn` that essentially contains `\[[!map
pages="tagged(open_issue_gdb)"]]`.  So far, so good: this page indeed does list
all pages that are tagged like this.  But now, when I add in `/gdb.mdwn` a link
to this page, like `\[[Open Issues|tag/open_issue_gdb]]`, then `/gdb.mdwn`
itself shows up in the map on `tag/open_issues_gdb.mdwn`.  In my understanding
this is due to the wikilink being equal to a `\[[!tag ...]]`.  What's the
rationale on this, or what am I doing wrong, and how to achieve what I want?
