Escaping pipe-symbol in [[taglink|ikwiki/directive/taglink]] targets doesn't work as I wanted:

[[!taglink smth_with_a_pipe|about_the_\|-symbol]]
[[!taglink smth_with_a_pipe|about_the_|-symbol]]

as opposed to simple wikilinks:

[[a link to smth with a pipe|about the \|-symbol]]
[[a link to smth with a pipe|about the |-symbol]]

And it seems to work in pagespecs:

tagged:

[[!map pages="tagged(about the |-symbol)"]]

[[!map pages="tagged(about the \|-symbol)"]]

link:

[[!map pages="link(about the |-symbol)"]]

[[!map pages="link(about the \|-symbol)"]]
