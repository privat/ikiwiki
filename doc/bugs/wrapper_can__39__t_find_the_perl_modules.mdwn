If i intsall perl modules in my custom directory, cgi wrapper can't find them. I found clearing enviroment variables in code  of wrapper. But information about custom directories put to perl with PERL5LIB variable.

Workaround: add newenviron variable PERL5LIB

My additional question - what wrapper do? I'am russian hosting provider. I am interesting with ikiwiki.

> The wrapper allows ikiwiki to run as the user who owns the wiki, which
> is generally not the same as the user that runs the web server.
> (It also handles some other things, like some locking.)
> 
> As a suid program, the wrapper cannot safely let environment variables
> pass through.

> be built to look in that location. --[[Joey]]  [[!tag done]]
