I have the following structure:

## page0
    # Page 0
    \[[!inline raw="yes" pages="page1"]]

## page1
    # Page 1
    \[[!inline pages="page2"]]

## page2
    # Page 2
    test

In this situation, a change in page 2 will trigger a rebuild of page1 but not of page0.

    refreshing wiki..
    scanning page2.mdwn
    rendering page2.mdwn
    rendering page1.mdwn, which depends on page2
    done

In my real world situation, page1 is actually listing all pages that match a certain tag and page0 is the home page.
Whenever a page got tagged, it will appear on page1 but not on page0.

Am I missing something? Is this a bug or Ikiwiki not supposed to support this use case?
