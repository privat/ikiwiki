I've just finished an upgrade to 3.141 and am trying to give myself admin rights to play with the new webadmin features.  My login is via OpenID but from reading on the wiki I believe that OpenID users should be able to be granted admin rights.  However I'm obviously doing something wrong as when I click on the "Preferences" link at the top of the page I don't see any admin features.

My login is: http://adam.shand.net/

In .ikiwiki/userdb I see:

> adam@shand.net
> email <br>
> password <br>
> locked_pages <br>
> banned <br>
> 1229722296 <br>
> regdate <br>
> http://adam.shand.net/ <br>

And in my config file I have:

> adminuser => [qw{http://adam.shand.net/}],

Any pointers to what I'm doing wrong would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
Adam.

I was being incredibly stupid and missed that websetup is a **plugin** and thus needed to be enabled.  Many thanks for your patient assistance, by helping me eliminate the unlikely it eventually led me to the obvious.  Cheers.  -- [[Adam]]
