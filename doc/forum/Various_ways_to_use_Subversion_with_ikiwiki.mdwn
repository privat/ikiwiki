I'm playing around with various ways that I can use subversion with ikiwiki.

* Is it possible to have ikiwiki point to a subversion repository which is on a different server?  The basic checkin/checkout functionality seems to work but there doesn't seem to be any way to make the post-commit hook work for a non-local server?

> This is difficult to do since ikiwiki's post-commit wrapper expects to

> away without running the post-commit wrapper on commit, and all you lose
> is the ability to send commit notification emails.

> (And now that [[recentchanges]] includes rss, you can just subscribe to
> that, no need to worry about commit notification emails anymore.)

* Is it possible / sensible to have ikiwiki share a subversion repository with other data (either completely unrelated files or another ikiwiki instance)?  This works in part but again the post-commit hook seems problematic.
