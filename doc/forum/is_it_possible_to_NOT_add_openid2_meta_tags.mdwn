### "meta openid" problems

I have add the followning to _index.mdwn_ on my site.

    \[[!meta openid="http://certifi.ca/lunix"
    server="http://certifi.ca/_serve"]]

This resulted in the following being added to my site

    <link href="http://certifi.ca/_serve" rel="openid.server" />
    <link href="http://certifi.ca/_serve" rel="openid2.provider" />
    <link href="http://certifi.ca/lunix" rel="openid.delegate" />
    <link href="http://certifi.ca/lunix" rel="openid2.local_id" /> -->

Perhaps I have done something wrong but this fails to work when I try to log in to several sites using my sites url as my login.  
If I edit index.html and remove the two openid2 lines all works fine.  
**Is there a way to only add openid version 1 tags to my index.html ?  
Or a way to make it work the way it is ?**  

Cheers
