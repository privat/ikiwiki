### "meta openid" problems

I have add the followning to _index.mdwn_ on my site.

    \[[!meta openid="http://certifi.ca/lunix"
    server="http://certifi.ca/_serve"]]

This resulted in the following being added to my site

    <link href="http://certifi.ca/_serve" rel="openid.server" />
    <link href="http://certifi.ca/_serve" rel="openid2.provider" />
    <link href="http://certifi.ca/lunix" rel="openid.delegate" />
    <link href="http://certifi.ca/lunix" rel="openid2.local_id" /> -->

Perhaps I have done something wrong but this fails to work when I try to log in to several sites using my sites url as my login.  
If I edit index.html and remove the two openid2 lines all works fine.

I was using _phpMyID_ and its not _openid2_ compliant so I switched to certifi.ca to counteract that but I really  
want to go back to running my own provider.  
I can't login to identi.ca.unless I comment out the openid2 lines.(this may be there problem, I get sent to certifi.ca's site and redirected back to identi.ca)    
I will test all the different openid enabled sites I log into today and see what happens.  
It seems that since I have moved my site to its final location and made it live over night I am able to login to most places now.   
I do not have a proper understanding of the inner workings of openid so not exactly sure what part is failing but I think the problem  
lays with the consumers not falling back to the openid1 tags when they are openid1 only consumers.  --[Mick](http://www.lunix.com.au)

I can't log into identi.ca with openid2 tags. strange. I will look at that again today.  
Having the option to disable openid2 tags would be perfect. 
Thanks Joey. --[Mick](http://www.lunix.com.au)

Ahh so it's not just me.  
It's handy having contacts in the _right_ places.  --[Mick](http://www.lunix.com.au)

## awesome.
