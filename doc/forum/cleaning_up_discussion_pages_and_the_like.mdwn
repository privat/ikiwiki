For example in [[forum/ikiwiki__39__s_notion_of_time]], should one remove the
text about the implementation bug that has been fixed, or should it stay there,
for reference?  --[[tschwinge]]

That's also what I think: such discussions or comments on [[forum]] discussion
pages, or generally on all pages' [[Discussion]] subpages, can be removed if
either they're simply not valid / interesting / ... anymore, or if they've been
used to improve the *real* documentation.  --[[tschwinge]]
