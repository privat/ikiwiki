I'm very excited to try out ikiwiki, since it should fit my purposes extremely well, but I'm having trouble with the search plugin. I'm pretty sure that right after I installed ikiwiki and needed dependencies, the search plugin was working fine. However, now when I try to use search, I get "Exception: Unknown function `this'" error on a blank page. I'm not sure how I should go about debugging this issue - my server's (I use Lighttpd 1.4.22) error log has no mention of the exception and there's nothing in /var/log/syslog either.

What might be causing this exception and how I might go about debugging exceptions?
