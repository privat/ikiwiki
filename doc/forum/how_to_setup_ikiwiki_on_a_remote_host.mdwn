Hi all!
I really like ikiwiki and i tested it on my local machine but i have one question that i can't answer reading documentation (my fault of course)...
I have an account and some space on a free hosting service.
Now, i want to put my ikiwiki on this remote web space so that i can browse it from wherever i want.
I have my source dir and my git dir on my local machine.
How can i upload my ikiwiki on the remote host and manage it via git as i can do when i test it locally?
Where is specified? Where can i find documentation about it?

Thanks in advance!

Thanks a lot for your answer.
rsync plugin would be perfect but... how would i manage blog post?
I mean... is it possible to manage ikiwiki blog too with rsync plugin in the way you told me? --Pab

> If you want to allow people to make comments on your blog, no, the rsync plugin will not help, since it will upload a completely static site where nobody can make comments.  Comments require a full IkiWiki setup with CGI enabled, so that people add content (comments) from the web. --[[KathrynAndersen]]
