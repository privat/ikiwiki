when I login via to this wiki (or ours) via Google's OpenID, I get this error:

Error: OpenID failure: no_identity_server: The provided URL doesn't declare its OpenID identity server. 

Any idea how to fix this??

So, while the above bug will probably get fixed sooner or later,
the best approach for those of you needing a google openid now is
to use gmail.


Just a note that someone has apparently figured out how to use a google
openid, and not a third-party provider either, to edit this site. 
The openid is
<https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawltlTwUCL_Fr1siQn94GV65-XwQH5XSku4>
(what a mouthfull!), and I don't know who that is or how to use it since it
points to a fairly useless xml document, rather than a web page. --[[Joey]]
