when I login via to this wiki (or ours) via Google's OpenID, I get this error:

Error: OpenID failure: no_identity_server: The provided URL doesn't declare its OpenID identity server. 

Any idea how to fix this??

>> A little more information here:  I'm using that same openid provider at the moment.  Note that

    <link rel="openid.server" href="http://openid-provider.appspot.com/will.uther">
    <link rel="openid.delegate" href="http://openid-provider.appspot.com/will.uther">
