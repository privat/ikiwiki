Hi,

I have successfully installed and set up my first instance of [[ikiwiki]] on my dedicated server. Following [[joey]]'s screencasts made this easy (thank you).

Currently, I have set up the RCS to be git but I do not like this very much. I'd rather want darcs but if I replace rcs settings, it fails.

What should I put in the configuration file to use darcs ?

>>> Better news: It will be in version 2.10. --[[Joey]]
