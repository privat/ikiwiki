I'm getting a number of errors like this when running ikiwiki:

    utf8 "\xA2" does not map to Unicode at /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.0/IkiWiki.pm line 739, <$in> chunk 1.

I think it's because some of my files contain non-utf8, non-unicode, or somehow bad characters in them, probably fancy quotes and the like that have been copy-and-pasted from my web browser. The problem is that I have hundreds of files, I transferred them all over from pyblosxom to ikiwiki at once, and the error message doesn't tell me which file the error comes from. How can I fix this?

Thanks
