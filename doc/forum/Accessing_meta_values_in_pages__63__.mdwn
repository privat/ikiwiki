If I set a meta value on a page (lets say \[[!meta author="Adam Shand"]] is there some way to retrieve the value of author and put it somewhere visible on the page?  Eg. can I write:

author: $author

I know I can update the raw templates but it'd be nice to be able to do this in the pages them selves.

Cheers,
Adam.
