Hi All;

I'm trying to use a filter hook as part of making [[wikilinks|ikiwiki/wikilink]] work in [[plugins/contrib/tex4ht]].
It seems that filter is called for every page. For my application I just want it to be called for ".tex" files, 
but right now I have to have a look at the content, which I don't like so much.

Is there a better hook to use for this? I need to transform the input before preprocessing.

>You can check the type of the page without having to look at the content of the page:

    my $page_file=$pagesources{$page};
    my $page_type=pagetype($page_file);

>Then you can check whether `$page_type` is "tex".
