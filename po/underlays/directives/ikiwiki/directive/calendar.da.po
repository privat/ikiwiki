"The month format calendar simply links to any page posted on each day of the "
"month. The year format calendar links to archive pages, with names like "
"`archives/2007` (for all of 2007)  and `archives/2007/01` (for January, "
"2007). For this to work, you'll need to create these archive pages. They "
"typically use [[inline]] to display or list pages created in the given time "
"frame."
